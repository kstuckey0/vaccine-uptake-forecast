# vaccine-uptake-forecast

This project explores U.S. COVID-19 vaccine uptake trends and applies supervised machine learning models to predict future uptake behavior for different demographics. Using CDC time-series data, the notebook applies regression models to forecast short-term uptake and clusters regions with similar dynamics.

Technologies: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, XGBoost
ML Techniques: Time series forecasting, regression, k-means clustering, cross-validation
